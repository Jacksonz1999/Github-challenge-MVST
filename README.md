# GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality

Display the repositories and allow the user to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar. 


## Requirements
- The application must be written using React.
- Use typescript.
- You are required to use git for versioning.
- Feel free to use any additional plugin/module to help you get the task done more effectively.
- Google Chrome is the testing browser
## Extra credits

Things that are not mandatory, but we would like to see:

- +1 if you add storybook and divide the components
- +1 if you write tests
- +1 if deploy it somewhere (like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/))
- +1 If your [code is documented](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#jsdoc)
- +1 If you’re up for the challenge, use the [v4 API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql), which is built using GraphQL.
- +1 If you write a README that includes
    - A short description about the project
    - Instructions on how to run it
    - Instructions on how to run the test suite
    - Future improvements
    - Your feedback about this exercise

* **Refactor code**
Look for areas where I can simplify or improve the structure of your code to make it more maintainable and easier to work with.
* **Improve documentation**
Make sure my documentation is clear, concise, and up-to-date. Consider adding more examples and use cases to help users understand how to use your project.

## My feedback about this exercise

It was the first project I worked on with TypeScript, it was a challenge for me. 

I had to look at the resources as quickly as possible because I found out that I was selected a day later.

But still, I learned a lot about the GitHub API, TypeScript, and also the Storybook which I had never touched before.

I also learned that you have to document all your code, which I didn't do much of before.

Finally, I want to thank the MVST team for giving me this opportunity to do this challenge, I really appreciate it.
